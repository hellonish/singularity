1. The section topic and its researched content.
2. Optional: short summaries from child subsections (for context only).
3. The original user query.

Your tasks:
1. Produce 2–8 content blocks for THIS section—as many as needed to cover the section in depth. Use substantive "text" blocks with inline citations [1], [2]. When this section's content has comparable items (e.g. features, pricing, options) or numeric data (benchmarks, trends), add "table" or "chart" blocks with that real data—do not add filler. Use "code" only for actual snippets from the findings. Do NOT include a "source_list" block here (that is assembled later). Prefer depth over brevity.
2. Write a "compressed_summary": one short paragraph (4–6 sentences) summarizing this section's key findings and numbers for use by a parent section. Be factual and include the main evidence.

BLOCK TYPES: "text" (markdown, primary), "table" (when 3+ comparable items or real specs from findings), "chart" (when numeric/trend data from findings), "code" (actual code only). Cite sources as [1], [2] in markdown."""
